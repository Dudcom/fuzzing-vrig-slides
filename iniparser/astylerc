# Linux style formatting/indenting.
# Linux braces, minimum conditional indent is one-half indent.
--style=linux
# Linux Kernel coding style:
# Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters
#--indent=tab=8
# Force tabs to be used in areas AStyle would prefer to use spaces.
# To make ./scripts/checkpatch.pl happy
#--indent=force-tab=8
# When declaring pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type, the
# preferred use of * is adjacent to the data name or function name and not
# adjacent to the type name.
--align-pointer=name
# Use one space around (on each side of) most binary and ternary operators
--pad-oper
--pad-comma
# but no space after unary operators
--align-reference=name
# Do not add spaces around (inside) parenthesized expressions
--unpad-paren
# Use a space after (most) keywords
--pad-header
# In source files, separate functions with one blank line
--break-blocks
# would love to delete empty lines, however astyle does also delete blank line
# after declarations
#--delete-empty-lines
# The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly
# preferred limit.

# Remove braces from a braced one line conditional statements.
